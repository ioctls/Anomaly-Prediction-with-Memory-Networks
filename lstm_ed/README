#Anomaly Prediction using lstm encoder decoder

Reference: The model is take from https://github.com/KDD-OpenSource/DeepADoTS and is further modified to suit needs of this project

src/algorithms/ has model files
src/data_collection/ has scripts used to collect data from RUBIS broker 
src/online_prediction/ has scripts to detect anomalies on latest data using pretrained model
src/report_generation/ has scripts to generate prediction tags/scores for anomalous_data and then get_reports.py to generate results
src/training/ has script to train the model


/data has anomalous_data used for generating results and training_data used for generating models
/figures has the roc/pr curves generated
/reports have generated reports and accuracy, precison, recall etc scores in scores_* files
